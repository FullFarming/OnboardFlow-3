Addition to Onboarding Application Specification (Phase 6)
Feature: Image Captions for Content Curriculum
Objective: To enable administrators to add a descriptive text caption to each individual image, whether it's a single-image content item or part of a multi-image slideshow. This caption will then be displayed to the user along with the corresponding image.

1. Admin Panel Modifications
1.1. UI/UX Changes in Content Management
The "Create New Content" form must be updated to include text input fields for captions.

For Image Content Type:

When an admin uploads a single image, a new text field must appear directly below the file upload area.

Component: A <textarea> is recommended for multi-line descriptions.

Label: "Image Caption"

Placeholder Text: "Enter a description for the image..."

For Image Slideshow Content Type:

The image preview area, which appears after files are selected, must be redesigned.

For each image thumbnail displayed in the preview area, there must be an associated and distinct caption input field placed directly beside or below it.

The structure for each item in the preview list should be: [Image Thumbnail] + [Caption Text Input/Textarea] + [Delete Button].

The drag-and-drop reordering functionality must be applied to this entire block, ensuring that when an image is moved, its corresponding caption field moves with it, maintaining the correct pairing.

1.2. Data Structure Modification (Backend & Database)
The structure of the contentSource field in the Content database table must be updated to store both the image URL and its caption.

For Image Content Type:

Current Structure: A simple string URL.

"contentSource": "/uploads/company_building.jpg"
New Structure: A JSON object containing url and caption keys.

JSON

{
  "contentSource": {
    "url": "/uploads/company_building.jpg",
    "caption": "This is our main office building located in Seoul."
  }
}
For Image Slideshow Content Type:

Current Structure: An array of string URLs.

"contentSource": [
  "/uploads/slide1.jpg",
  "/uploads/slide2.jpg"
]
New Structure: An array of JSON objects, where each object has url and caption keys.

JSON

{
  "contentSource": [
    {
      "url": "/uploads/slide1.jpg",
      "caption": "Step 1: Please sign the required HR documents."
    },
    {
      "url": "/uploads/slide2.jpg",
      "caption": "Step 2: Your buddy will give you a tour of the office."
    }
  ]
}
2. User-Side Modifications
2.1. Content Viewer Component Update
The component that displays images and slideshows to the end-user must be updated to render the new caption data.

For Image Content Viewer:

The viewer will fetch the content object ({url, caption}).

It will render the image using the url property.

Directly below the image, it will render the text from the caption property.

Styling: The caption text should be styled for clear readability (e.g., centered, slightly smaller font size than body text, with adequate spacing from the image).

For Image Slideshow Viewer:

The viewer will fetch the array of content objects ([{url, caption}, {url, caption}, ...]).

The slideshow logic will be updated. When displaying the image at index, it must also display the caption from the object at that same index.

Dynamic Update: As the user clicks the "Next" and "Previous" navigation buttons, both the displayed image and the caption text below it must change simultaneously to reflect the current item in the array.
