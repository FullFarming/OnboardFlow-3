Bug Fix Specification: Guide Sentences Not Displaying on User Interface
1. Problem Description
The guide sentences (also referred to as Markdown descriptions), which are entered and saved for each content item in the Admin Panel, are not visible on the user-facing side of the application. The UI currently displays the content images but fails to render their associated descriptive text below them.

2. Objective
Modify the user-side rendering components to correctly fetch and display the guide sentence for each content item. The final output should show the image followed by its corresponding formatted manual description.

## 3. Diagnostic and Resolution Steps
Step 1: Verify API Response 📡
First, confirm that the backend API is correctly sending the guide sentence data to the client.

Open the browser's Developer Tools (F12) on the user-side page where the content should be displayed.

Go to the Network tab.

Find the API request that fetches the content data (e.g., /api/content/{id}).

Inspect the Response or Preview tab for that request. The JSON data for each content item should contain the key for the guide, such as guideSentence or markdownContent.

If the key is missing: The problem is in the backend. You must update the API endpoint to include this field in the database query and the JSON response.

If the key is present: The problem is in the frontend. Proceed to the next step.

Step 2: Inspect Frontend Component Props 📦
Next, ensure that the data, once received from the API, is correctly passed down to the component responsible for rendering the content.

Using component inspection tools (e.g., React DevTools), select the component that renders a single content item (e.g., ManualStep, ContentViewer).

Check its props. Verify that the prop containing the guide sentence (e.g., props.markdownContent) is present and holds the correct string data.

If the prop is missing or empty: The issue is in the parent component's data handling logic. Check the state management and data-passing logic after the API call is resolved.

If the prop is present and correct: The issue is in the component's rendering logic. Proceed to the next step.

Step 3: Correct the Rendering Logic 🖥️
Finally, modify the component's render method to display the guide sentence. This is the most likely location of the error.

Action: Locate the JSX/HTML structure within the component's return statement. You must add the code to render the guide sentence prop.

Reminder: As this content is Markdown, it must be processed by a Markdown rendering library (e.g., react-markdown) to be displayed with formatting.

Example Implementation (React.js):

INCORRECT CODE (Current State):

JavaScript

function ManualStep({ imageUrl, caption }) {
  // The 'markdownContent' prop is received but NOT used.
  return (
    <div className="manual-step">
      <img src={imageUrl} alt={caption} />
      {/* Guide sentence is missing here */}
    </div>
  );
}
CORRECTED CODE (Required State):

JavaScript

import ReactMarkdown from 'react-markdown'; // Ensure this is imported

function ManualStep({ imageUrl, caption, markdownContent }) {
  return (
    <div className="manual-step">
      <img src={imageUrl} alt={caption} />
      
      {/* Add this section to render the guide sentence */}
      {markdownContent && (
        <div className="manual-description">
          <ReactMarkdown>{markdownContent}</ReactMarkdown>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
