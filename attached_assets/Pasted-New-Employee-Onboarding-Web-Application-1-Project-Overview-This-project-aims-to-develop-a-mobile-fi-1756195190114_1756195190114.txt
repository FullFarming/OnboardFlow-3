New Employee Onboarding Web Application
1. Project Overview
This project aims to develop a mobile-first web application on the Replit platform to streamline the onboarding process for new employees. The application will feature a distinct admin panel for managing users and content, and a user-facing interface for new hires to access essential information and training materials. The main page will feature a designated company image as its background.

2. Core Technologies & Platform

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (A framework like React or Vue.js is recommended for managing state and UI components).

Backend: Node.js with a framework like Express.js for handling API requests and server logic.

Database: A simple database solution available on Replit, such as Replit DB (a key-value store) or SQLite for structured data.

Design: Mobile-First Responsive Design.

3. Admin-Side Specifications
The admin side is a secure area for managing new employee accounts and their onboarding curriculum.

3.1 Admin Authentication

A table or list view displaying all registered new employees.

Each entry should show key details (userName, email).

Provide options next to each user to Edit their details or Delete their account.

3.3 Onboarding Content Management Dashboard
This dashboard allows admins to manage the educational modules that appear as icons on the user's main page.
